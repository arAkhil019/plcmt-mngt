   - Memory-efficient processing
   - Large collection support

2. **Audit Trail**:
   - All operations logged with metadata
   - User identification and timestamps
   - Operation details and results
   - Severity classification

## Implementation Details

### Bulk Delete Process
1. **Authorization Check**: Verify admin permissions
2. **Confirmation Validation**: Ensure correct confirmation string
3. **Collection Processing**: Process each collection individually
4. **Student Deletion**: Batch delete students (500 per batch)
5. **Stats Cleanup**: Remove department statistics
6. **Result Compilation**: Aggregate success/failure results
7. **Activity Logging**: Log bulk operation with details

### Bulk Archive Process
1. **Authorization Check**: Verify admin permissions
2. **Collection Processing**: Archive each collection individually
3. **Data Preservation**: Move to archive with metadata
4. **Result Compilation**: Track successes and failures
5. **Activity Logging**: Record archive operations

### UI Workflow
1. **Collection Display**: Grid view with selection checkboxes
2. **Bulk Selection**: Select individual or all collections
3. **Operation Choice**: Choose archive or delete operation
4. **Confirmation Modal**: Review selections and confirm
5. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time operation status
6. **Result Display**: Comprehensive operation results

## Configuration

### Confirmation Strings
- **Bulk Delete**: `BULK-DELETE-{count}-COLLECTIONS`
- **Individual Delete**: `DELETE-{DEPARTMENT_NAME}`

### Batch Limits
- **Firestore Batch Size**: 500 documents per batch
- **Collection Processing**: Sequential processing for stability
- **Error Handling**: Continue processing on individual failures

### Security Settings
- **Required Roles**: admin, super_admin
- **Activity Logging**: All operations logged
- **Confirmation Requirements**: Typed confirmations for destructive operations

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:
1. **Navigate to Collection Management**: Click "Collection Management" tab
2. **Select Collections**: Use checkboxes to select collections
3. **Choose Operation**: Click "Archive" or "Delete" button
4. **Review Selections**: Confirm collections in modal
5. **Type Confirmation**: Enter required confirmation string (for delete)
6. **Execute Operation**: Click confirm to proceed
7. **Review Results**: Check operation summary and any errors

### Best Practices:
- **Test with Small Sets**: Start with few collections for testing
- **Use Archive First**: Archive before delete for safety
- **Review Error Messages**: Check individual collection failures
- **Monitor Activity Logs**: Review logged operations for audit
- **Backup Critical Data**: Ensure important collections are backed up

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios:
1. **Permission Denied**: User lacks admin privileges
2. **Invalid Confirmation**: Incorrect confirmation string
3. **Collection Not Found**: Department doesn't exist
4. **Batch Limit Exceeded**: Large collections requiring multiple batches
5. **Network Issues**: Connectivity problems during operation

### Error Recovery:
- **Partial Success Handling**: Track completed operations
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages with collection names
- **Operation Status**: Clear indication of what succeeded/failed
- **Retry Capability**: Failed collections can be retried individually

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features:
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk document operations
- **Sequential Processing**: Prevents overwhelming Firestore
- **Memory Management**: Efficient processing of large collections
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time operation status

### Scalability:
- **Large Collection Support**: Handles thousands of students per collection
- **Multiple Collection Support**: Process dozens of collections simultaneously
- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of Firestore quota
- **Error Isolation**: Individual collection failures don't stop entire operation

## Summary

The bulk collection management system provides administrators with powerful tools to efficiently manage multiple student collections while maintaining safety, security, and data integrity. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling, detailed logging, and user-friendly interfaces for large-scale administrative operations.

### Key Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Process multiple collections simultaneously
- **Safety**: Multiple confirmation layers for destructive operations
